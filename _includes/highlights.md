Reservator
----------

Reservator is a meeting room display system for tablets. Mount your tablet next to your meeting rooms door, install Reservator and you’re good to go! Reservator uses your Google calendar’s resources for booking so you can use it, for example, for conference rooms, classrooms or for lending a video projector. While using Reservator, you can still book rooms normally through Google Calendar. You can also use the application for reserving other meeting rooms within your company.

VPN Management
--------------

VPN Management is a self-service tool for your employees to handle their OpenVPN certificates. The tool consists of two parts, the server and the installation wizard.

FUM
---

FUM is an user management system for LDAP. FUM makes it easy to handle information about your employees, their projects and servers they have access to. LDAP is a good protocol for user management, but it needs an user-friendly layer on top of it. One of the strengths of FUM is that it gives the users a lot of freedom over their data.
